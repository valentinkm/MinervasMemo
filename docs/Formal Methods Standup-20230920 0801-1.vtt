1 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:17.309
Okay, we're now being recorded um, thank you so much all for coming. Sorry that I can't be there at the, but I also see that. I don't see a lot of MTI backgrounds. Um, so I'm not the only 1.

2 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:23.910
Uh, we have a couple of things to go through, um.

3 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:43.910
So fast, we last time we talked about this modeling conference, and I was thinking that, maybe at 1 of the meetings where Oman is present, uh, we should all sit together and talk about the upcoming conferences for the next year and maybe make a plan together.

4 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.260
I mean, we have this repository with all the conferences that we were interested. I think.

5 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:06.900
End of last year, and, uh, we should update that before, but I think then we should be good to go to discuss, uh, who wants to go where, and we should do that before December so that we can make a budget, um, for that as well. Um.

6 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:26.900
Then I heard that Anna Lumen is, uh, was sick for a couple of weeks. That is why we didn't make any progress on taxonomy. Um, but I have a meeting with her next Monday. And if you want something that I discussed before, or if you even want to join.

7 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.280
Um, it's Monday at 3. um.

8 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.400
Yeah, write me an email.

9 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.216
I'll speak now it's shot, um.

10 "Valentin Kriegmair" (2132423168)
00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:48.434
Do you need the online, I guess yes. Yes. Um, yeah, so maybe I can just join in and listen or yeah.

11 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:48.434 --> 00:02:05.291
Yeah, that would be good. Um, can you still write me an email so that I don't forget to invite you. Okay. Um, then I wanted to ask maximian is everything all right with your poster? I, I guess it is.

12 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.735
Yes, it's now officially entrance.

13 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:16.140
To here, but, um, you have to drive to the Institute yesterday. They couldn't do it without me.

14 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
Yeah, I mean, everyone needs to, um.

15 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:40.940
Quite sensible of them uh, I invited the equity representative, Maria. I'm on a team meeting to present on equity. Um, but she has, like, a week ago. Um, but she hasn't responded and maybe it's just the wrong email.

16 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.020
Oh, no, 1 looks at the equity at email ever. So maybe I follow up on that. Um.

17 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:05.220
Then I discussed with Mike that we want to do a Julia workshop at the Institute, because it went so smoothly in Munich. I thought that would be like a nice thing to do and not to, um.

18 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:15.000
Strenuous fast, um, she's she suggested 2 dates based on, uh, our photo.

19 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.260
That's apparently I haven't pasted in the email into the agenda. So where do I find that? I don't think I find that uh.

20 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.550
What someone's you see on that email.

21 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.750
Nope, right. Mm. Hmm. Okay. I, I have to look that up in a minute. Um, maybe you yeah.

22 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.751
I looked that up and then we can decide if we can do it on 1 of the 2 days. Um, I think.

23 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:56.993
If you want to know yes, the date the date yeah each 210th, 11th and 14+17 uh, November both. Okay.

24 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:56.993 --> 00:04:01.831
Okay, and repeat, uh, so, November, right? So we have to.

25 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:13.570
8 to 10th of November is the 1st period and 14+the 17th of November is the 2nd date. She code.

26 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.640
Okay, so we have basically 4 different dates.

27 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:31.429
Are there any preferences mark? Apparently not um.

28 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:35.310
I would say there are a little better. Okay.

29 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:47.759
Um, then, uh, move, it will not join because they just come to psych Academy at the same time. But there is also maybe a plus because we could.

30 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.913
I don't know what the plan for the contract is there already a program.

31 "Moritz" (3183618560)
00:04:52.913 --> 00:04:58.093
I don't know Fox, but otherwise I have no idea. Okay.

32 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:03.149
Because then we can also write, look an email and tell her that.

33 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:10.349
We are offering the workshop anyway, and if some other companies, like people want to join, because they are involved in any way they can.

34 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.659
Mm, hmm. Okay. Um, so it's decided that we do.

35 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:21.899
I don't know whatever was in the 1st, week of November, like 8 or 10 or something.

36 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:30.899
Um, good. So what's the next agenda point? Um, then in Munich, we, uh.

37 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:45.209
hannah's hannah's, Nicholas. Sorry Nicholas and movers and I discussed a lot about getting things done, uh, which is this kind of framework that I've been using for years, uh, on and off and.

38 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:05:45.209 --> 00:06:05.209
I have been reading the book because I dropped the ball at some point. So, for example, I forgot at some point, I'm very sorry about that. Um, and I was wondering, is there any interest, uh, that we spend probably 2 hours like, on a quick start on this.

39 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:14.369
Our methodology of like, organizing to do lists and calendars and life. Is there some interest? Maybe.

40 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:21.449
I don't see everyone, so you can just use the reaction thing. I.

41 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.509
I think if I may, I think that's a great idea. Also. It could be possible to invite someone as external speaker.

42 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.679
I mean, that's always also an option. I mean, it's great if you do it.

43 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:44.874
But if you talk to some, I don't know, there's probably central funding. If you, if you ask YMCA, for example, if you attach just to 1 of the graduate schools. Um, yeah. Maybe yeah.

44 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:59.309
Maybe additional input yeah, maybe I ask as well, especially because, uh, the company behind getting things done or David Allan, which is basically a company in itself. Um, they.

45 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:19.309
Will release the getting things done for teams next year, uh, beginning next year. Maybe then we can do like a formal then we can invite someone, uh, for, like, how to actually implement it as a team. But this is like, concentrated on personal organization. Um, also Leoni.

46 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:38.549
Okay, yeah. Okay. Then I know that there is some interest I write an email to and, uh, think about like, how extensive it has to be, but I think like, in in 2 hours, we can get through most of the materials and get you started. Um.

47 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:45.119
Then I want you to ask Nicholas, uh, have you officially reached guest status?

48 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:58.259
I was there on the phone. It's terrible. No, Nicholas. It's not there, right? No. Okay. Um.

49 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:05.999
Then next thing is the which is pertaining hannah's and Maximilian.

50 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:11.339
So, you are good to go and you know what you want to do.

51 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:17.132
And you have a date, right? Yeah. 13rd of December is okay.

52 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:17.132 --> 00:08:25.199
Um, if you want, you can also, uh, like, do a test run after 1 of the team meetings.

53 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:31.289
Um, but probably would be a good idea to schedule it early because.

54 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:35.339
Yeah, the team meetings already, um.

55 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:40.986
Like, they are conflicting with some other events, but if you want to.

56 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:47.746
I would love to there is no presentation right now there will be 1 and then I would schedule it.

57 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:47.746 --> 00:08:53.159
Okay, um, and my community, you mentioned that you are not.

58 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:58.686
Quite interested in giving a colloquium talk um, yeah.

59 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:06.449
So, my point was, I am doing a lab and I already have, I will already present at the.

60 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:15.119
Meeting I will do to Julia workshop I will present in the colloquium here with class because I have to do this as part of my reputation.

61 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:19.469
And I wanted to present in the colloquium of maybe.

62 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:23.579
Because I want to get some feedback on how to simulate language on the data.

63 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:27.539
And I'm not too eager.

64 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:32.909
To have a 5th presentation October yeah.

65 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:37.499
So, I, I, and I also don't have too much to present at the moment.

66 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:48.779
That's yeah, not too much where I would like to have feedback from the colloquium because I, at the moment, I need methodological feedback. Mandy.

67 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:52.864
So, yeah, I.

68 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:58.349
You can, of course, do a presentation on, like, your whole vision. I think that is also what this.

69 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:09:58.349 --> 00:10:18.349
Date is supposed to be like your 33 year vision of, like, what you want to tackle, um, basically an extended version of what you presented to Oman, um, and clouds but I agree that 5 talks within a month. This may be a little bit too much. Um.

70 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:10:18.349 --> 00:10:24.299
On the other hand, um, the places are counted.

71 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:30.119
And you were like, on on the list that woman, um.

72 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:36.149
Yeah, decided should present so, I don't know Andrea. What is your opinion?

73 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.109
I mean, if you're on the list by man, that's, uh.

74 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:47.189
Difficult to decline I would say.

75 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.368
And I know I, I perfectly, I mean, I feel you, Maximilian, um.

76 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:53.754
The thing is, I mean, the, it's.

77 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:56.819
Actually, a relatively short talk, right? And.

78 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:10:56.819 --> 00:11:03.419
I mean, is there something that we can that the group can join can prepare? And basically Max, only the.

79 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:06.749
Presenter or something that there will be an option of course.

80 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:12.269
Something like that, it's about the Julia package or, I mean, but that's something.

81 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:16.471
Everyone heard already, right?

82 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:23.879
Yeah, I think the problem is, if I present, I would have to present my PhD stuff because that's basically the.

83 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:29.073
Idea by the students on the list.

84 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:38.613
All right. Okay. And is it possible to just swap with somebody else so that it's later for you in time?

85 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:11:38.613 --> 00:11:43.799
I mean, the date, there's still a couple of open and we can definitely swap.

86 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:52.707
We can also just ask if former methods wants to present something, because I think maybe we could do a presentation about taxonomy.

87 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:52.707 --> 00:11:58.589
I mean, you're right I'm sorry. I mean, I, I was just reminded because this is the new format, of course, and the new format.

88 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:03.689
So, every new PhD student has to present.

89 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:11.991
This is the new rule. So, present that's simply something that Omar basically ordered everyone to do.

90 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:12:11.991 --> 00:12:15.927
The thing is that maximum is of course, not a new PhD students.

91 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:12:15.927 --> 00:12:18.971
Yeah, but yeah.

92 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:24.310
He is not yet the PhD student at. Yeah. So.

93 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.709
I mean, I think my my offer would be to just ask for a delay.

94 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:35.947
So that's okay. Excellent. Presents with the family method slot, but later, because he hasn't really started yet. Yeah.

95 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:12:35.947 --> 00:12:40.319
Okay, so I write an email and get the, uh.

96 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:49.705
Temperature of maybe we switch. Maybe. I mean, the dates are already known which we can pick um.

97 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:53.909
I mean, I would be very happy, I mean, the days until December now.

98 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:12:53.909 --> 00:12:59.819
I would be very happy to present early January because then I'm at the.

99 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:03.239
And I have to present.

100 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:11.399
I have to from like, um, for the school of commercial side, I have to present in the colloquium next year.

101 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:20.386
Maybe maybe February, and this will also be my evaluation presentation because I have to do a presentation anyways.

102 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:13:20.386 --> 00:13:26.771
But, I mean, that's the perfect reason, right? If you mentioned this by the way album, then yes yes.

103 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:31.399
Okay, so so I write an email to Martin telling that we have to do it.

104 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.409
In January because of former requirements.

105 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:39.247
And, uh, hope that we get an okay for.

106 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:13:39.247 --> 00:13:45.968
I guess it's best to do February, because this is my final presentation of the then. So okay.

107 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:45.968 --> 00:13:48.584
Okay, okay.

108 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:48.584 --> 00:13:53.849
To ever to evaluate my performance. Okay.

109 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:13:53.849 --> 00:13:59.091
Um, maybe maximian can you draft this email and send it to me? Yes.

110 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:13:59.091 --> 00:14:01.765
Do this okay?

111 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:10.379
Um, so only 2 more things, then we are through. I'm sorry, we are running late. I know. Um.

112 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:27.089
So the meeting the stand up that will be happening during the meeting will be canceled. So I'll, I'll cancel it in a minute just so that, you know, if you see a canceled E, mail, what exact meeting was canceled, um, it is.

113 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:34.240
I don't know when the meeting is, but but we are conflicting, like, heavily, uh, with a couple of things.

114 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.579
October.

115 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:45.449
Of October, um, also, just so, you know that, like, we have to be present there. Um, like like.

116 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:52.499
Harmless, you have to be there uh, Andreas, you have to be there and I don't think anyone else has to be there.

117 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:52.499 --> 00:14:57.629
Yeah, that's.

118 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:07.469
Yes, and hannah's, we have to follow it and I also put like all the dates into into the formal methods thing where we have to be present.

119 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:19.289
Which is on October um, last point is archive.

120 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:24.389
Um, which is this chat bot for the research report? Um.

121 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:44.389
I worked on it on the during the open science thing in Munich. Um, and it was quite complicated to get, like, large language models, run within guitar actions and then, like an automated container deployment. Um, but now I'm very happy with the result. Um, which means if you ever.

122 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:50.759
To automatically deploy a container somewhere we have now a repository that can be role model.

123 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:15:50.759 --> 00:16:02.399
On how to do it explicitly if you have, like, API keys that have to be kept secret. But I'd need a drink builds time entering run time and so forth. So.

124 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:12.556
Um, and I wanted to ask, uh, hannah's what what the state is because you worked on it yesterday, right? Yes. Um, I.

125 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:22.399
Safe and also a couple of weeks town, so that can capture the question entry has asked it. So I think it will work now.

126 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:26.669
Quite better because no understands what art means and also.

127 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:16:26.669 --> 00:16:46.669
Center and so on, um, but it failed yesterday to build because of something. I'm not completely sure it was later in the night. So I ended it there, but I run locally and I couldn't break it anymore, but it failed to build on. I will look into it.

128 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:49.737
Today, maybe you have time with it, then we can maybe.

129 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:16:49.737 --> 00:16:53.159
Um, maybe I can come.

130 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:58.739
By spontaneously, because I don't know, like, how long this, uh, thing here road 1.

131 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:09.869
And where I have to be present and things, because they moved the program, and that it's the program is not on the line. They had just 1 slide and I didn't photograph it.

132 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:17.309
Yeah, change it. Um, so maybe yeah, um, later today it can come by.

133 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:24.719
Um, but, yes, then we should build it and maybe we can just finish this project. Um, today, then.

134 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:32.159
Okay, uh, that was everything that I wanted to discuss. Um.

135 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:17:32.159 --> 00:17:36.357
Is there something that you want to discuss?

136 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:42.348
Actually added a couple of points that you don't see because you probably have to refresh your project view, but it's yeah.

137 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:46.475
I really short. Okay. Okay. It's it's Super short.

138 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:17:46.475 --> 00:17:55.399
I just wanted to mention that the 2 of us and maximum should discuss the resubmission of the base paper and, um.

139 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:17:55.399 --> 00:18:05.339
I participated in the meta rep, um, discussion, which is sort of a project that tries to acquire more funding from the for.

140 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:08.729
For all sorts of research and applicability of.

141 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:08.729 --> 00:18:12.809
Uh, psychological and behavioral and cognitive research.

142 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:18.899
Um, that's sort of a, a longer thing that we should separately discuss, but that's probably something where we could.

143 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:32.399
Apply for funding, like, for a, say, a PhD or a Pre position, and I wanted to just let, you know that I'm part of the defense committee of.

144 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:42.899
At H*, which the defense will probably be somewhere in January, but I thought that's may be interesting to know. Um.

145 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:54.869
And I think Maximilian and somebody added probably 2 more points. Yeah. And I just wanted to ask if there are comments on the ranch logo that I sent around.

146 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:18:54.869 --> 00:19:02.529
And then it's something we want to pursue further of whether we want to drop this, or whether you want to have more colors or more variations on.

147 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:19:02.529 --> 00:19:16.797
No, go ahead. I like the ranch logo, but I think the f codes look a little bit more ranch like, because otherwise you don't see it. Like, you only see it after you, you know.

148 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:19:16.797 --> 00:19:21.275
Okay, let's try to do it more like.

149 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:19:21.275 --> 00:19:25.571
But.

150 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:19:25.571 --> 00:19:34.169
It's also, okay, it's just an f, because it's common method. So as long as it doesn't look like the Facebook. Ef. That'll be fine.

151 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:38.759
Okay.

152 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:44.073
Hello.

153 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:48.299
And maybe we actually want to do the logo contest. I love the idea.

154 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:53.969
That we just sit together for an hour and draw, like, funny stuff.

155 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:19:53.969 --> 00:20:01.578
On paper for the next team meeting where we also do the whole thing.

156 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:20:06.212 --> 00:20:09.954
Be good and I think Maximilian has 2 last points and then we have.

157 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:09.954 --> 00:20:19.769
So, should I present next week in a team meeting my poster because it's 2 weeks to the meeting and they never did the poster presentation.

158 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:23.915
And I also wonder if woman wants to see the presentation.

159 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:30.813
Yeah, that's a good idea that show us the poster and explicitly invite women to the meeting next week.

160 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:36.269
Here I will do that and.

161 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:43.829
Then the last point was, we should meet andrea's Ireland I should meet about the.

162 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:55.133
Box device reliability project, because we don't really know what to do with it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

163 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:58.013
Let's let's find that date, like a separate.

164 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:20:58.013 --> 00:20:59.435
Yes, yeah.

165 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:03.433
In a separate channel for base prereq and for.

166 "Andreas Brandmaier" (590238464)
00:21:03.433 --> 00:21:08.834
The universe and everything. Yeah.

167 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:20.759
Okay, um, sorry, that we, uh, took a little bit longer. It's sometimes not quite easy to see how much we need for our internal stuff.

168 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:25.799
Um, but I glad, uh, 2 guests from MP, like.

169 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:29.639
School of cognition joined, uh.

170 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:32.699
Yeah, you have.

171 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:36.779
Half the floor, maybe you both want to introduce yourself real quick.

172 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:41.472
Uh, and it will stop the recording. Um, I think.

173 "Kağan Porsuk" (4294940928)
00:21:41.472 --> 00:21:46.548
Because the owner will then present some things. Hi.
