1 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:17.309
Okay, we're now being recorded um, thank you so much all for coming. Sorry that I can't be there at the, but I also see that. I don't see a lot of MTI backgrounds. Um, so I'm not the only 1.

2 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:23.910
Uh, we have a couple of things to go through, um.

3 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:43.910
So fast, we last time we talked about this modeling conference, and I was thinking that, maybe at 1 of the meetings where Oman is present, uh, we should all sit together and talk about the upcoming conferences for the next year and maybe make a plan together.

4 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.260
I mean, we have this repository with all the conferences that we were interested. I think.

5 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:06.900
End of last year, and, uh, we should update that before, but I think then we should be good to go to discuss, uh, who wants to go where, and we should do that before December so that we can make a budget, um, for that as well. Um.

6 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:26.900
Then I heard that Anna Lumen is, uh, was sick for a couple of weeks. That is why we didn't make any progress on taxonomy. Um, but I have a meeting with her next Monday. And if you want something that I discussed before, or if you even want to join.

7 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.280
Um, it's Monday at 3. um.

8 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.400
Yeah, write me an email.

9 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.216
I'll speak now it's shot, um.

10 "Valentin Kriegmair" (2132423168)
00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:48.434
Do you need the online, I guess yes. Yes. Um, yeah, so maybe I can just join in and listen or yeah.

11 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:01:48.434 --> 00:02:05.291
Yeah, that would be good. Um, can you still write me an email so that I don't forget to invite you. Okay. Um, then I wanted to ask maximian is everything all right with your poster? I, I guess it is.

12 "Maximilian Ernst" (180413952)
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.735
Yes, it's now officially entrance.

13 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:16.140
To here, but, um, you have to drive to the Institute yesterday. They couldn't do it without me.

14 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
Yeah, I mean, everyone needs to, um.

15 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:40.940
Quite sensible of them uh, I invited the equity representative, Maria. I'm on a team meeting to present on equity. Um, but she has, like, a week ago. Um, but she hasn't responded and maybe it's just the wrong email.

16 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.020
Oh, no, 1 looks at the equity at email ever. So maybe I follow up on that. Um.

17 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:05.220
Then I discussed with Mike that we want to do a Julia workshop at the Institute, because it went so smoothly in Munich. I thought that would be like a nice thing to do and not to, um.

18 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:15.000
Strenuous fast, um, she's she suggested 2 dates based on, uh, our photo.

19 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.260
That's apparently I haven't pasted in the email into the agenda. So where do I find that? I don't think I find that uh.

20 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.550
What someone's you see on that email.

21 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.750
Nope, right. Mm. Hmm. Okay. I, I have to look that up in a minute. Um, maybe you yeah.

22 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.751
I looked that up and then we can decide if we can do it on 1 of the 2 days. Um, I think.

23 "Hannes" (1269292032)

25 "Hannes" (1269292032)
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:13.570
8 to 10th of November is the 1st period and 14+the 17th of November is the 2nd date. She code.

26 "Aaron Peikert" (2274650112)
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.640
Okay, so we have basically 4 different dates.
