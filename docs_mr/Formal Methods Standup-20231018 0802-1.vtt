00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.248
Okay, so.

2 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:00:01.248 --> 00:00:05.970
Now, the meeting is recorded, um, sin.

3 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:25.970
I'm I'm officially now an employee of the mix blankets again. Um, but all my rights have been revoked so there's no transcription. Very nice. Um, anyway, we'll still record it because I think if they enable it, I get transcriptions back.

4 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:45.980
Hopefully, because all other transcription also deleted. Um, but but not the recording themselves. So maybe maybe you have some hope to get this up and running. Um, maybe if you have some time, I think today could be a full day in. So it's very cool. And it's very sunny outside. Um.

5 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.110
So, we can join in in later, um.

6 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:06.090
Logo contest has to be done. Sometime. I just keep it in there as a reminder. Um, I have finished revision of the base paper and just waiting on and maximum helium on.

7 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.950
Getting some feedback, um, so that we can resubmit.

8 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.569
Uh, naturally project meeting is still on, or, I don't know. I wasn't sure if I should remove it marks. Yeah.

9 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.955
Yeah, I guess I just have to write them an email now reminding them that we are waiting for. Okay.

10 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:30.840
That stuff, so, Marx is writing an email reminder enough to lead.

11 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.530
Come to bring them in November.

12 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.190
Okay, and then we should be a good time to sit together.

13 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:50.880
Yeah, ideally we would get this stuff before we should mention that that if we get the stuff before, then we can prepare something and it means this will bring up the days.

14 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.640
So, November, 11, instead of 2009, 9.

15 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.700
This is, uh, and he'll be a way for in the middle.

16 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
Probably you probably arrived, but November 11.

17 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.770
Nice and 79.

18 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.240
I should put that in the car. Yes. Yes. That would be excellent. Um.

19 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.328
So, regarding yeah, um, I.

20 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:27.720
Can only really understand that 1 because all the other ones are very.

21 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.683
Silence okay.

22 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:39.705
That's nice because we now got a microphone specifically so that you can hear everyone.

23 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.004
Okay, so.

24 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:48.029
I guess, uh, I will buy another 1.

25 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.230
In place 2 at 2.

26 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.910
Places in the room, is this the microphone? This is the microphone activated.

27 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.105
I'm pretty short activated, so it's like, let's make.

28 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:06.868
Mary, she plays it in the middle of everyone. It would work. I don't know. And it will be.

29 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:09.404
The floor I'm sharing.

30 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:14.451
Yeah, that's interesting.

31 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:17.910
Actually, I think we should have like, a, you know, that.

32 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.930
Hey, Swan yes.

33 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.020
No, I like they can connect those to each other. So we have to have 2.

34 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.029
Oh, is this fine now?

35 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:47.864
Somebody asked the newness to ask. Um, do you hear me? Um, I think it's better now. Everybody's like, on the same level between understanding and.

36 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:51.962
Doesn't mean, we have to stop making jokes about you now.

37 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:56.310
But I think it works now. I mean, maybe Nicholas to.

38 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.452
I mean, you can understand it, I guess, uh.

39 "Nicklas Hafiz" (3171545856)
00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:02.866
Everybody has the same level of silence. Mm. Hmm.

40 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:07.830
Yeah, okay. And increase.

41 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.060
The sensitivity of mine, so this should be now she wanted to show. Okay how much.

42 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.770
Years yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Just better.

43 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.429
Okay, so do you mind any new glances? Well.

44 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:39.719
Um, so where are we, and after the, um, yeah, and then the calendar. So if you see something in the calendar and you're not sure what it is, it probably means you're going to have to attend just.

45 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:53.219
When in doubt, I hope it's clear where to I think you can trust intuition, uh, what's relevant or what not, but it's not true outside of just putting stuff in the calendar. Hey, someone works.

46 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.509
Wants to join, but it's just easier. Um.

47 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:11.489
The research colloquium is upcoming on November pass from 10 to 11 and I think that would be a nice thing also for student research systems to come because.

48 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:31.489
Series a very short talk, it's 5 minutes, but talk 2 minutes crashing around. Um, and so it's everyone has to present, uh, that at some point at the, and is from all departments. So you get an overview of what other research is done here at the Institute. Um.

49 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:39.389
You can anticipate remotely if you want. Um, but if you want to come in and you have to send an email.

50 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:52.019
Uh, to provide some slides from, uh, you want to go, uh, it's in the description of the items registrations.

51 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:05:52.019 --> 00:06:06.209
Then that is the burden science we going on. I'm specifically there's a panel discussion on November 1st, and I pointed this out, because they will be food.

52 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.779
Um.

53 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.139
Then, Nicholas, we have lots of.

54 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:21.449
Ask for high performance compute access for you right? You have the contract now, but you still need access.

55 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.959
And and you have done those process before.

56 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.759
There is a.

57 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.189
Um.

58 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:46.019
Okay, uh, I will ask her yeah, because they keep changing these things. It's called the source.

59 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:52.829
But it may not exist 1 of those things that used to be resource. Now that I'm on the format.

60 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:57.539
So you have to ask, okay.

61 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.619
Um, then.

62 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.219
In now it's only the same grid.

63 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:13.019
And you can also test the production that, um, yes, the managers, there's the actual administration.

64 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.699
Yeah, yeah, this is somebody who has a contract with the.

65 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:26.039
And meet us to have an account.

66 "Nicklas Hafiz" (3171545856)
00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:33.028
I don't think so. Do I have to apply for this? 1?

67 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:37.049
It's not me, I account. Yes, but the contract.

68 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:47.459
and then they can okay we have to create an account and then uh yeah just maybe yeah this one is not no this is a ticket in the system 

69 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:07:47.459 --> 00:08:00.269
Um, which last time I did, it resulted in MIA, getting my account reset it 3 times for each account that was created since my.

70 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:09.509
Um, then the last item that I put on here is, uh, PhD, uh, Navigator thing.

71 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:17.219
I don't know, I was under the impression that doing is almost as complicated as doing a PhD.

72 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:30.449
Curious, um, that is quite difficult to navigate all the steps and I have been talking to a couple of people on how we can improve the process. And then it would be very nice to have, like.

73 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:37.709
Some kind of automated checklists and reminder things because there are so many things that you have to do in.

74 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:44.159
Particular order, ideally, um, and are very many research institutions like.

75 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:57.509
Absolutely, the tech meeting, then you have the, the research block we only have to go presenting the conference user meeting. Then you have to get ethics approval then you have to register study and you have to confirm the library if you're.

76 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:01.349
Publish something, and this is as all the.

77 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:08.069
Everything has to be done. Everything has to be done in a particular all that had at the right time. And I don't think that's even possible for us.

78 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:11.129
And so they will be.

79 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:15.539
A meeting on the last day, um.

80 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:24.989
And I wanted to yeah, probably at some point. Pick your brain those who start, uh, PhD yeah. What.

81 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:24.989 --> 00:09:34.409
You, it's fine so it's from 2 to 3, uh, tomorrow and 961 2.

82 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:39.689
Come along to complain. Um, that's that's fine because we are thinking about, okay, what.

83 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:43.169
What can we do? Um, to make this process easier.

84 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:49.079
Yeah, and if you have anything like, oh, you really should.

85 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:53.129
Thing about this particular problem we should talk about that.

86 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:09:53.129 --> 00:10:01.019
Yep, and that, um, I'm through my items, but I think there are a couple of items open.

87 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:14.249
That's that's my mine. Yeah, so I, I, I would quickly try to share my screen.

88 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:17.939
Uh, the, the.

89 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:26.369
Okay.

90 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:38.909
Now, I'm sharing, so I know that probably most of you already noticed and have worked with this, but not, uh, I haven't until last week.

91 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:51.899
Well, I had to kind of dive into a topic that I was not familiar with at all and it can be really hard because there are a lot of papers out there and especially the recent papers of not only on archives.

92 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:10:51.899 --> 00:11:01.019
So, I realized that all the major machine learning conferences, use, open review for the review process.

93 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:09.509
And I was obviously I was aware that something like this exists, but I always thought, well, who's going to look at this anyway?

94 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:22.169
But actually, it's really incredibly helpful because they give you so much. So, for example, when they, when they decide on whether to accept it.

95 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:35.969
They give you a whole summary of the of the paper basically for free that you can read instead of kind of reading the whole paper. So you get like, a better than summary basically, for free.

96 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:41.489
And you get also the decisions from our, the reviewers in in a nice format.

97 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:44.579
But, for example, just the correctness.

98 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.659
And the novelty separately.

99 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:59.189
So, even if a paper's rejected, you can still see okay. It just seems to be technically correct. But maybe the improvement was not so large, but you can still.

100 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:06.719
Use the contents, if you want to, and you can sign it even if it's only published on archive because you can see that basically agreed.

101 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:14.129
That's the paper's correct. For example, and something that I found funny is, um.

102 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:23.039
They can even touch their own confidence in the review. So they so very often. You actually see reviewers saying, like, I only have the confidence of 2 or 3.

103 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:31.649
And they say, uh, well, I have quite some trouble actually understanding where the papers about. So, don't take my review too seriously.

104 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:36.509
So, yeah, I just wanted to share this with the people that maybe don't know this.

105 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:56.509
I think that this is really nice, and it's really a huge improvement from what the psychology conference are doing, which is just giving you a decision with no with no justification at all. And they even have you rejected on the desk projected submissions.

106 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:06.449
Look at them, and you can see they will give you a reason why they why it does projected so yeah, I think that's very cool. Mm. Hmm.

107 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:09.975
Hello.

108 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:13:09.975 --> 00:13:29.539
I didn't know about it really looks pretty cool and then next time should prepare for reproducible research if our workload pieces. Um, yeah, so Leo, and I, um, started working officially on our instance yesterday and I remember that.

109 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:50.419
A couple of weeks ago, Max actually mentioned that, uh, when we start working on a paper or thesis, we should feel free, or should be encouraged to come speak to you and Aaron to maybe get yeah. Kind of a quick introduction into this. Uh.

110 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:54.899
How you actually rise up from paper from the very beginning it gets up.

111 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.589
Um, and I think this would be a timely.

112 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:08.339
Thing now for us, um, yeah, in case you have any free time left or? Um, yeah.

113 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:11.369
We would be we appreciate it.

114 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:14.609
Yeah, definitely, um.

115 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:20.489
I guess we will talk in about a year about it. Any right but.

116 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:29.969
I actually think that, um, yeah, that like these, how to collaborate, why I can talk is actually.

117 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:37.889
It's interesting and important anyway, and maybe we want to invest in some more time into that. Instead of just.

118 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:43.649
Talking in only, but maybe we can figure out what is it exactly. Need us.

119 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:48.899
Involved in your the weekly usability workshop to.

120 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:14:48.899 --> 00:15:00.839
To do the collaborative editing and the conference on automating research products in optimal. I wanted to talk about.

121 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:08.879
Collaboration, but I haven't I just on the plan that I want to talk about it. Okay that anything.

122 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:16.019
So this sounds like we should talk to today even a little bit about it and.

123 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:23.579
Figure out, what is the best format for you to get up and running? And maybe by other people to.

124 "Aaron Peikert" (1776789760)
00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:30.810
That should help other people a little bit and maybe something with a conference of action as well. Yeah.

125 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.519
Yeah, I also thought that this would make an amazing workshop actually.

126 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:50.099
Because even if you're not, um, familiar with good and get up, there's still a lot of very nice tools that that can offer you for writing your paper. So you don't have to be an experts. But.

127 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:15:50.099 --> 00:16:02.489
Just tracking everything with, uh, we are issues and assigning it to your collaborators and something like this is already, I think, a huge step forward for.

128 "Maximilian Ernst" (941395968)
00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:06.179
For most people at their paper writing workflows.
