Okay, we're now being recorded um, thank you so much all for coming. Sorry that I can't be there at the, but I also see that. I don't see a lot of MTI backgrounds. Um, so I'm not the only 1.
Uh, we have a couple of things to go through, um.
So fast, we last time we talked about this modeling conference, and I was thinking that, maybe at 1 of the meetings where Oman is present, uh, we should all sit together and talk about the upcoming conferences for the next year and maybe make a plan together.
I mean, we have this repository with all the conferences that we were interested. I think.
End of last year, and, uh, we should update that before, but I think then we should be good to go to discuss, uh, who wants to go where, and we should do that before December so that we can make a budget, um, for that as well. Um.
Then I heard that Anna Lumen is, uh, was sick for a couple of weeks. That is why we didn't make any progress on taxonomy. Um, but I have a meeting with her next Monday. And if you want something that I discussed before, or if you even want to join.
Um, it's Monday at 3. um.
Yeah, write me an email.
I'll speak now it's shot, um.


### "Valentin Kriegmair" [00:01:39.216-00:01:48.434]
Do you need the online, I guess yes. Yes. Um, yeah, so maybe I can just join in and listen or yeah.


### "Aaron Peikert" [00:01:48.434-00:02:05.291]
Yeah, that would be good. Um, can you still write me an email so that I don't forget to invite you. Okay. Um, then I wanted to ask maximian is everything all right with your poster? I, I guess it is.


### "Maximilian Ernst" [00:02:05.291-00:02:10.735]
Yes, it's now officially entrance.


### "Aaron Peikert" [00:03:36.750-00:03:42.751]
To here, but, um, you have to drive to the Institute yesterday. They couldn't do it without me.
Yeah, I mean, everyone needs to, um.
Quite sensible of them uh, I invited the equity representative, Maria. I'm on a team meeting to present on equity. Um, but she has, like, a week ago. Um, but she hasn't responded and maybe it's just the wrong email.
Oh, no, 1 looks at the equity at email ever. So maybe I follow up on that. Um.
Then I discussed with Mike that we want to do a Julia workshop at the Institute, because it went so smoothly in Munich. I thought that would be like a nice thing to do and not to, um.
Strenuous fast, um, she's she suggested 2 dates based on, uh, our photo.
That's apparently I haven't pasted in the email into the agenda. So where do I find that? I don't think I find that uh.
What someone's you see on that email.
Nope, right. Mm. Hmm. Okay. I, I have to look that up in a minute. Um, maybe you yeah.
I looked that up and then we can decide if we can do it on 1 of the 2 days. Um, I think.
