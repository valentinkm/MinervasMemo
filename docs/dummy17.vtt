00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:21.050
So, the recording has now started because volunteering has made great progress at building ai tools, um, meeting summaries uh, and that, uh, I'm looking forward to the, to the summary of this meeting. Um, also, um, made great progress in artificial.

2 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:41.050
A chatbot deployment, so I think the chatbot is live already and I think we could also share a link. I guess, at the team maybe harness you can can send an email around with the, with the back link. So that people can can try and break the chatbot.

3 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:55.560
Um, I'm currently working on, like, automatic deployment of the chatbot and have great fun with Docker and get up actions. Uh, while I'm sitting here and listening to talks. Um, so.

4 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:07.854
Maybe andrea's, you can start you, you put in the modeling conference quite a while ago and we never discussed it in the meeting. Maybe you want to say something.

5 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:18.840
Yes, so this is the 3. M, right? I keep forgetting what the acronym stands for, but it's apparently a modeling statistical model in conference where a lot of.

6 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
People from the sort of psychological methods.

7 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.690
Group, uh, going from the U. S. and from Europe as far as I know.

8 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.180
And multiple people have recommended over the years that I should go down.

9 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:44.970
And every year I had a different excuse so I'm just passing this on. It seems to be a very interesting group of people.

10 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.777
To share that methodological research and I think it would be good if we show our faces there next year or whenever yeah.

11 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:57.193
Do you already have an excuse for for next year? No.

12 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:01:57.193 --> 00:02:06.540
We are trying to come, I actually would really like to go and I think this is the 1 where they alternate between Europe and the US. I'm not sure.

13 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.437
Okay, we have to check on this. Yeah.

14 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:16.276
I mean, we started this project with all the conferences. Yeah, yeah.

15 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:23.550
Specifically, I, I think specifically the Julia structure, the equation modeling package would be something that would be highly.

16 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.995
Interesting for these group of people. True.

17 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.547
Yeah, I don't.

18 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:34.410
No, maybe this is even like people, like, and these show up there.

19 "Andreas Brandmaier" (941395968)
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.315
So, why not let them know that we have something better? Yeah.

20 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:47.820
It sounds like a good plan. I mean, the U. S traveler is a little bit of a put off, but.

21 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:08.960
But if it's interesting enough, maybe maybe then we can can manage to go there. Um, so then the next point is, uh, also a long time on there like that we all made some light touches for the website for the formal methods website. Um.

22 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.710
And maybe you guys want to, to take a look. It's really just like light updates, uh, from.

23 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:26.430
From the old version, like the new group images on there and I think, like, the mission statement is slightly altered. Um, but.

24 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:45.030
Nothing big, but so, uh, if you have some comments, I'd like to hear them, um, then the next stand up it might be that I cannot attend because there's the open science ambassador meeting at the hallmark house. Um, and the.

25 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.800
Walking group open times, ask me to attend and I mostly like.

26 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.550
Later in the day there's a panel discussion. So let's see if I can sneak out um.

27 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.790
Nevertheless, I think Max should be available or maybe address to, to lead the meeting.

28 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:19.770
Um, yeah, Julia workshop everything is an order. Yeah, I left that in just to say that. Um, I think the joy workshop was like a pleasant surprise. We had like, full attendance. So we had, like, 40 people in there and we were 4 facilitators.

29 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:27.119
So more words, um, hannah's was online, uh, I, and Maximilian.

30 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:46.799
And I think actually, that we can scale this up even further. I saw it, like, 40 people would be the limit but, um, we barely had anything to do, uh, in the workshop. Uh, and so I think like, even 100 people could be, like, facilitated with 4 people, um, for like.

31 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:04:46.799 --> 00:05:02.759
Ratio of like 20 to 30 people per facilitator, um, is, I think feasible and good news. hannah's I think, uh, is, uh, uh, offer to pay you. Um, also, uh, like a small honorary.

32 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.539
For for helping out.

33 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:16.019
Um, and if you don't hear anything about it, please remind me that I have sent me an email around, um.

34 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:24.239
Then, the taxonomy status is, my understanding is that, like, nothing has happened, um, in the.

35 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:38.099
Last couple of weeks, um, I mean, I delayed, it didn't quite keep to the timetable of sending around like, this ideal lies new shame around.

36 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.019
But it's correct that, but you didn't meet with Ana, right?

37 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:54.029
Okay, so that means we have to, like, come up with a, with a date for meeting with Anna, or, like, organize some, some meeting.

38 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:59.999
I think like, next week is not good, but week after that should be.

39 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:05.789
Um, at least if I have 1 to attend and person.

40 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:13.439
Yeah, hmm, I mean, next week is 20, like.

41 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:24.005
Yeah, I send an email around, but are you available at the 27th of September? No, no, no.

42 "Leonie" (1229484800)
00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:34.245
This would be the week that I am planning to be, um, on vacation. So I'm at the 27th. I wouldn't be there. Okay.

43 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:41.219
On vacation next 3 weeks.

44 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.369
Okay, I honestly don't know then what we should do about it.

45 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:06:47.369 --> 00:07:07.369
Yeah, we would need to involve me or depending on how long the meeting will take. I can try to. No, no, no vacation should be holy. Um, and also, um, Leo is not there he's at the internships or like, it would only be on it.

46 "Aaron Peikert" (119267584)
00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:17.069
Me, I guess, I mean, maybe then I will just meet with another 1 on 1 and, uh, discuss, uh, what we can do.
