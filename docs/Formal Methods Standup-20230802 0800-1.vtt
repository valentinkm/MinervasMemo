Yeah.

2 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, uh, so with that, um, welcome everybody, um, to the pharma rapid stand up. Um, people told me that he has fascinating stuff on customers and information theory, and that he like to present that at some point. And I guess best would be.

3 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Be some after some of the stand ups in September.

4 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.920
Because, yeah, we are many of us are away in August and then September would be nice and then we can just.

5 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.380
Book a slot after that just pick 1 in September, I guess, right?

6 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:47.976
Um, all on, you had some things on the, uh, symposium and advance cause of confidential psychiatry.

7 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:53.370
Yes, can you hear me? Yeah. Okay so.

8 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:05.370
Uh, as you may know there is the so called Max plank center for computation psychiatry, aging research, which is.

9 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:23.850
Led by in London and me and Berlin, and associated to that center there also is, uh, international maximum research school interest called. Uh.

10 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.220
Computational methods in psychiatry and aging research and.

11 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
These 2 together, uh, the maximum currency, I'll center.

12 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.610
And the interest computational methods.

13 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.750
Uh, have developed the, the habit.

14 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.930
Of running every other year. Actually, already before the center was founded since 2014.

15 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.010
What we call a symposium and advanced course, which basically is a week.

16 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:18.660
Of lectures and emperor room for informal conversations, and the last 1 happened in 2022 at castle mama, and was Co sponsored by the Jacobs foundation and focused on.

17 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:29.040
Memory development in childhood, the others before focused on other things, such as, for instance, decision making or.

18 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.490
The use of computation methods and understanding.

19 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.700
Mechanisms underlying pathology, such as depression or schizophrenia.

20 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.820
Now, 2000.

21 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:54.540
Um, 24 am I talking about? Yes, I'm talking about 34 is a special situation because.

22 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
Uh, the Max center will be in between 2.

23 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:16.710
Uh, brought up between 2, uh, periods of funding because it then we'll have existed by 10 years. Uh, and D centers are typically 2 times 5.

24 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:32.490
Years and then if you get a 2nd extension for a 3rd term, this is an, uh, an extension to which the maximum society, the central maximum society no longer contributes funds. It's basically an extension without.

25 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.030
Funding, and we are just in the process of getting there and therefore 2024.

26 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.240
The symposium and advanced course will not be held as it was the case before.

27 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.050
It is a cost of thing back and.

28 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:01.380
Uh, or that, like Constance, but instead, and now I'm coming to the thing that I wanted to announce it will be held as a.

29 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:13.350
Summer course organized by the nuisance school of advanced studies and s. A. S in Venice. So.

30 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.650
Uh, not to be more precise, not in Venice, but on a little islands.

31 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:35.339
Called, which is 1 of the few islands, if not the only 1 that is not owned by 1 of the very, very expensive hotels, but instead is owned by the University of Venice and is a former monastery.

32 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:38.879
And, uh, is overlooking.

33 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:45.089
The Laguna, including I've thought courses there already.

34 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.199
Um, and the topic of this.

35 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.039
Advanced advanced course, which will be organized, but not taught.

36 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.089
I write down myself is on.

37 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:06.749
Machine learning on artificial intelligence basically the use of artificial intelligence.

38 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:21.779
In making sense of brain data, in predicting psycho pathology in explaining things that you didn't know exists and all the kinds of users that artificial intelligence may be good for. And.

39 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.829
Uh, it will be run as a summer course of this.

40 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:41.039
And s. A. S. and so we are, we have basically convinced the organizer or the, the guy running the school with a number of Luigi.

41 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.579
That he would make this part of.

42 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:05:44.579 --> 00:06:00.089
The offer of the, in this way, we basically bridge the gap between funding because we don't have the funding to go to the castle. But of course, we still can offer a course in the context of, of a different enterprise.

43 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:10.049
So, all this is to say, and, and the course typically is for advanced Pre Docs and post Docs. But of course, if if, uh.

44 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:30.525
Not very advanced Pre dog happens to have a topic for his dissertation, or her dissertation that fits the topic of AI then this person might be just as illegible and I just wanted to let, you know, in fact, I should also let, you know, about the dates. Uh.

45 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:33.339
Uh.

46 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:46.083
I, um, let's just find out whether I, I have them already in my calendar at sometime in September 24. um.

47 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:50.996
Yeah.

48 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:54.089
Yes, it starts.

49 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.509
It starts probably on.

50 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.829
Saturday September 7.

51 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:08.159
2024 and ends on Saturday.

52 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.109
September 14 2024.

53 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:16.889
Okay, uh, no, I.

54 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:28.769
And and of course, we should think who of of the former methods group would like to go, would like to attend. And I think it should be a mixed mixture of interest. And also.

55 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:33.119
Relevance for whatever your, um.

56 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:47.249
I mean, this is something that Alan has to decide I should say. So I should I should shut up, but I could imagine that WH, what what what would be important is the degree to which, uh, the topics of that cause.

57 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:54.479
Uh, are relevant for whatever people are doing in terms of the dissertation or qualification projects.

58 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:01.917
Um, yeah, and I just wanted to let, you know about this in advance.

59 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:13.199
Cool at 1st I was disappointed that it's not in 1 of the classes but then you said, uh, which we then happened to enjoy, uh, now that it's on the end dangerous.

60 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.702
List of the United Nations.

61 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:29.369
Yes, and, I mean, it doesn't happen very often that you wake up and check a walk and have a look at some Marco and, uh, need to get a little to, to get to the place in the 1st place. So.

62 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:44.598
Whoever likes Venice wants to see Venice and never has been there. I mean, uh, apart from the scholarly objectives of such a school, uh, might might consider yeah.

63 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:08:44.598 --> 00:08:52.599
Yeah, we have to think about a process, um, and probably you and I should also talk about it, right? At some point. Yeah.

64 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.040
Okay.

65 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:06.809
Speaking of dates, um, I invited almost everyone to Google calendar. I wasn't sure whether or not I should invite the team on, uh, as well.

66 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:17.849
Um, but the rest of you should have gotten an email about a former methods calendar. Um, main purpose is, uh, vacations and things like.

67 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:22.409
Dennis, um.

68 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:36.629
Yeah, but if I didn't include you, then I was just not sure whether I should and you can just write an email if you haven't gotten access to it. Um, everyone should be admin. So.

69 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:41.039
Yeah, you can add another people.

70 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:49.349
Any questions to the regards to the calendar or advanced course no.

71 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:09:49.349 --> 00:10:05.999
Then next thing is, I added this, uh, draft for procedural checklists and and Nicholas have already reviewed it and add a comments. Um, but.

72 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:11.309
The others happened so far. Um, but I'd like to.

73 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:21.239
Move move on with these things and close this full request sometime in the next 2 weeks. So if you have thoughts on it, um.

74 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:34.933
Then I can finalize it and send, uh, more final version. I mean, it's, it's called living overview and, uh, I still intended to be living, but, uh, yeah. Um.

75 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:42.152
Uh, can you just remind me of how to access this? This is also on this type thing or how does this work.

76 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:42.152 --> 00:10:52.379
Yes, it was also on this, get something. I send an email I sent a link in the chat where this particular pool request.

77 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:56.759
Yes, and then share my screen for a moment.

78 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:10:56.759 --> 00:11:08.729
So so this is how it looks like an initial draft procedure checklists. Um.

79 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:14.549
And then you can see, um, what has changed if you click on files changed.

80 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:22.229
And they you see how to get feedback, uh, how to use Git hub.

81 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:35.009
And you can add comments like Nicholas did here, or listed here. Um, and there are a couple of things, for example, how, how you should prepare for meetings and so forth. Um.

82 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:44.459
Yeah, just for the reoccurring things. That might be interesting. For example, what we have to do when we want to offer a workshop and these things.

83 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:50.579
Just written it down so that you can take a look. I know.

84 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:56.362
Have some hints on how to proceed with these things.

85 "Ulman Lindenberger" (2406992896)
00:11:56.362 --> 00:11:58.858
Thank you.

86 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:11:58.858 --> 00:12:04.889
Um, so then.

87 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:24.889
I have added a couple of interesting blog posts in there, because I like to read them and find them fun. 1, is that if you ask how the professors to grade in an undergraduate course, for social sciences. So the whole bachelor program at Howard, it gets a grumpy and average of 3 point.

88 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:30.809
2, which is pretty amazing to just think that chatbot can.

89 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:35.519
Yeah, get a bachelors at Harvard um.

90 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:47.429
Not a great bachelor's. That's still very good. Um, then there's also an interesting blog post. Uh, that is very critically, uh, critical of peer review. Um.

91 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:47.429 --> 00:12:59.039
Which I just found interesting, just the history of it, for example, that Einstein submitted once a paper. And when you got peer review it, he was so upset that he retracted the paper.

92 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:15.869
On the ground of being upset about peer review. Um, and the last, uh, Blockbuster I added is 1 that is discussing how to build the architecture for large language models and how to turn that language into products.

93 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:24.719
Which we are pursuing for the research report, chat bot and also, hopefully, at some point for all the meetings.

94 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:28.019
And, yeah, fascinating to read those.

95 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:44.639
So, applicable peer review, um, sadly, the Bayesian peer registration paper, uh, that has submitted recycled psychological methods, got rejected, uh, very extensive.

96 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:49.259
Peer review by Daniel, basically saying oh.

97 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:52.349
The stage of rationalization is not a.

98 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:13:52.349 --> 00:14:06.899
Thing and so I disagree on it everything, um, which was quite sad to see then the editor to reject it because I don't think Daniel a candidate to get rejected just to be very critical of the.

99 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:13.649
Pharmaceutical standpoint taken, but the editor probably read it. S.

100 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:27.779
Yeah, not as a dispute that as a very high quality or something. So I intend to to take a look at the peer review and re, submit to psychological.

101 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:32.099
Perspectives on psychological sciences.

102 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:45.989
Yeah, what what are you doing? Um, and then, uh, there's this huge mess with the, um, travel to Munich for the open science week. Um.

103 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:53.189
So, everyone at 1st, we thought everyone was going at the same time that it turns out.

104 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:58.469
Multiple people have multiple things. Um, and so.

105 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:14:58.469 --> 00:15:04.949
We maybe we do that for the people who go to Munich after this meeting, but sit together and.

106 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:08.849
Realize he was sitting in rich train and just.

107 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:08.849 --> 00:15:13.499
Being that 1, so.

108 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:18.449
What is that I have? I missed something.

109 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:37.019
Only the tack proceeding for, um, I don't know if you want to discuss it now because Omar said as well. Uh, I just talked to him. It just seems there is no other possibly the day before. Yeah. So, that's what we have to take even though I would be happy.

110 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:43.139
It wasn't wasn't possible. Okay. Okay. Um.

111 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:49.889
Yeah, I think that's it from my side of things.

112 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:53.939
And is there any, anyone else who wants to add.

113 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:15:56.994 --> 00:16:15.829
Yeah, maybe I can add a little something. Um, yeah, because I just heard from a friend that, um, in September, I think the week before, um, a lot of your goes to Munich and there's the, um, sounds good from the open science. There's also, um.

114 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:29.219
Like, a summer school at the, um, I think about computation of psychiatry, and they also offer the opportunity to do the courses online. Um, and it's not.

115 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:43.079
Um, I think you have to pay, like, 15 for attending the lectures and I think 100 to do the tutorials as well. And it's also for, I think 4 or 5 days. I'm not quite sure.

116 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:53.939
But maybe to some of you, this is also interesting. Um, because it also has like, the very, uh, neat opportunity to join, like, online if you don't want to go there. Um.

117 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:56.999
Yeah, so, uh, maybe.

118 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:08.669
I can also post this in the chat because I thought some of the topics are quite interesting. And others, I think, aren't that new to the most of us but.

119 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:16.499
Whoop, it's at this side. Um, yeah, and I thought it's very.

120 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:17:16.499 --> 00:17:20.219
Very convenient. And if someone has.

121 "Leonie Hagitte" (3326755584)
00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:27.074
The time and the opportunity to do more than this could be an opportunity as well. I think.

122 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:33.899
Very nice. I add this link to the agenda as well so that you can access it during the next week.

123 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:17:33.899 --> 00:17:43.979
Okay, um, I just remember that I think there was a tentative plan for taxonomy to meet.

124 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:53.639
Today, but, uh, since we haven't invited Anna, I suggest we do it next week. Um.

125 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:17:53.639 --> 00:18:09.839
And, yeah, I present, I think the taxonomy should go after having spoken to almost all of you if you want to discuss this today further just send me an email. I'm pretty free today.

126 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:24.419
Let me check. Yeah. So, after this meeting, I have time and no, this is wrong here. Okay so after this meeting, I have time and after lunch as well.

127 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:27.509
Okay, um.

128 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:41.789
Yeah, uh, I guess then we can say goodbye to most of the people both who are not planning to go to Munich and the rest can sit into discuss.

129 "Aaron Peikert" (733272064)
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:48.636
How do we get your Munich and so forth? Thank you so much.
